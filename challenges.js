Task 1: Library Late Fee Calculator 🚀🚀🚀🚀

You are working at a library and need to calculate late 
fees for overdue books. Write a function called `calculateLateFee` 
that takes the number of overdue days as input and calculates 
the fee ($0.25 per day). Prompt the user to input the
number of overdue days.

Log the result as:

"The late fee is $[amount]."

Example:
User Input: 10
Output: "The late fee is $2.50."

/*
STRETCH TASK: Student Grade Report Generator 🏈🏈🏈🏈

You are a teacher, and you want to automate the creation of detailed grade reports for your class. Write a program that includes the following steps:

1. Write a function called `calculateAverage` that takes three test scores (numbers) as parameters and returns the average of those scores.

2. Write another function called `determineGrade` that takes the average score as a parameter and returns the letter grade based on the following rules:
   - "A" for average scores of 90 and above
   - "B" for scores between 80 and 89
   - "C" for scores between 70 and 79
   - "F" for scores below 70

3. Write a third function called `generateReport` that:
   - Takes a student's name and three test scores as parameters.
   - Uses `calculateAverage` to calculate the average score.
   - Uses `determineGrade` to find the letter grade.
   - Returns a full report string in this format:
     "[StudentName] - Average Score: [average], Grade: [letterGrade]"

4. Finally, use the `prompt` function to input the student’s name and three test scores, and display the generated report using `console.log`.

Example:
User Input:
Name: Amina
Scores: 85, 90, 78

Output:
"Amina - Average Score: 84.33, Grade: B"

Extra Credit:
- Extend the program to accept multiple students' names and scores and generate a report for each student using a loop.
- Use an arrow function for at least one of the functions.
